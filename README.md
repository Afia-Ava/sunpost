SunPost is a simple web app that lets you write and send letters digitally, just like postcards. Once you send a letter, the recipient gets notified via email. To view the message, they enter their password for secure access. You can also check your past letters anytime in the archive.

Why I Built It: <br>
I wanted to reimagine the feeling of sending postcards in a digital age. Instead of fast, disposable messages, SunPost creates a more thoughtful way to write and receive notes, while still being quick and accessible online.

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JS

Functionality:<br>
- Write letters and send it<br>
- Recipient gets notified through email<br>
- Recipient has to use their password to view the letter<br>
- Check all your past sent letters in archive

Struggles and Learnings: <br>
Well I initially had a different plan with this site, to take one's AI chat input and generate personality card. I had a lot of issues with integrating Hugging Face or other sort of AI platforms and ended up making this. However, I do plan to learn more on AI integration to websites and make something like my initial plan.
